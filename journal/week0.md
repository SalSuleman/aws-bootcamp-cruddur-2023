Problem Areas:
- setting console access keys as env variables in gitpod, setting them was not a problem but I would get an InvalidClientTokenId error upon restarting gitpod
- understanding the architectural diagram components

Solutions:
- standard troubleshooting for the gitpod error
  - update: wokrking, created new keys, deleted all workspaces in gitpod and replaced env vars with new keys, keys work now but "aws sts get-caller-identity" returns id of old keys, checking IAM on aws management console confims new keys are being used and old keys are deactivated.
- research each component in diagram

This weeks takeaways:
- setting up proper security when it comes to IAM on an aws account
  - following the principle of least privilege
- creating IAM users and only using root account for very specific tasks
- setting up cli access to aws account
- setting up budgets and alerts
- how to use lucid charts, an easy to use and very useful tool
